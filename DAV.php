            <div class="content"><p>DAV Post Graduate College was established by its mother institution, Arya Vidya Sabha, Kashi. The idea behind its establishment was to open an institution in the heart of the city and under the umbrella of Banaras Hindu University, to cater to the need of the value and skill based education to the students.</p>

                <p>             
                    Two disciples of Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Ji, viz. Pt. Ram Narayan Mishra and Shri Gauri Shankar Prasad were instrumental in establishing the college. The college was established in 1938 as an Intermediate college recognized by Banaras Hindu University. It got degree status from the University in 1947 and permanent affiliation in 1954. The college started running undergraduate courses in the faculty of Arts, Social Sciences and Commerce, and in 2008 the University allowed the college to start Ph.D. Research and Post Graduate courses in four subjects namely, Commerce, Sociology, Economics and History. The College is catering with distinction not only to the needs of the students of the Eastern districts of U.P. but also the adjoining states too. </p>
                
                <p>Because of this, the University has allowed the college to start PG and Ph.D Courses in three more subjects viz. Psychology, Political Science & English from the session 2010-11. In the year 2014-15 the college also incorporated both PG and Ph.D. Research in the Departments of Hindi, and AIHC & Archaeology.

                </p>To promote ICT Practices and computer literacy, a separate unit / Department of UGDCA (Under Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications) within the premises of DAV PG College is functioning for the past years. In addition most of the Faculty Members are computer literate and deliver lectures through power point presentations and other ICT tools.


                
                <p>The DAV PG College, through Centre of UGDCA (Under Graduate Diploma in Computer Application) ensures that the basic knowledge, skills and the required training to all the registered students of various fields are provided on a continuous basis. This diploma course runs simultaneously with their regular graduation, thus adding no extra time-burden to our students.</p>

                <p>The establishment of the UGDCA Department in DAV PG College was not an easy task. Prior approval from Banaras Hindu University was taken to run this programme. In the absence of funds from BHU, the College runs this programme on ‘self-financing’ basi

                Swami Vivekananda, Bhagat Singh birthday celebrations are organised to inspire the students. Quests are organised by almost all the departments. All Department of the college have student forums which have the responsibility to develop the academic and personality enhancement. Like that, Department of Economics conducts ‘eco-voice’; Department of Political Science conducts ‘Republica’; Department of Hindi conducts ‘Pallav’; Department of AIHC & Arch conducts ‘Sanskriti’; ‘Voice of Commerce’ and ‘Spars’ are conducted by Department of Commerce. Such programms develop cultural awareness & competency and academic skills in the students. These competitions inculcate and train them to organize such event in their future
